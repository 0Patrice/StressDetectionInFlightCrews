In a hectic environment (maybe even with motion) it was not easy to grab the slider handle and place it correctly.
Also maybe it would have been easier to find the right “number” if there was a graph underneath showing the level of performance on the y axis and the activation level on the x axis. It looks like an inverted U, the maximum would correspond with the number that represents the tipping point  where the performance degrades and things get lost. One could immediately with a single view set the slider past this point if one feels overwhelmed.","1","I feel like this was already stressful, however the scenario was a bit forced (restarting the engine would not be attempted if the other one is working fine, everyone would have returned to Braunschweig immediately), If you really want to trigger maximum stress, set one engine on fire (inextinguishable) and fail the other one both right after takeoff. And maybe have bad weather and fail the ILS. But this would not result in a slow buildup of stress but rather a sudden onset.","Let’s start with the worst: The rudder. It is way too sensitive! Simply trying to takeoff or land and staying on the runway is impossible, especially with crosswind. Next, rudder trim only allows for a value of 2.0. For an engine failure, a value of around 10 is needed. I don’t know if force Feedback on the rudder pedals worked, but usually one can trim the rudder until no pressure on the pedals is needed anymore to keep the aircraft straight. Also the beta target on the PFD did not work (critical feature for an engine failure!).
The font and font size on almost every display is wrong, ND, pfd, MCDU don’t look familiar. The ND did not show a green line straight forward when flying in heading mode which it should.
The side sticks are too sensitive and don’t “feel right”.
System depth seems to be lacking a lot. As an example: Our left tank had a leak and was empty, however the APU continued to run although it is supplied out of the left tank. In flight, the ditching push button somehow turned on and could not be turned off again. This resulted in an increase of differential pressure since the outflow valve was closed. We opened it manually, but the indication stayed closed. Cabin altitude rose and did not stop rising, going even above our airplane altitude and releasing the oxygen masks.
Direct law was almost completely unflyable, it somehow required full sidestick deflections and even that was not enough to turn the airplane.
The simulator crashes when working on the flight plan in the FMS.

So overall I would say it is a bad platform to do serious research on as the pilots are constantly questioning weather something is intentional or a quirk of the simulator and fighting with the controls.","Get a new, professional and certified simulator :D","","1634.98","23.16","","1611.82","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
